An assessment of week 4 (BANKING SYSTEM)
#### In this assignment, i am  implementing  an online banking system. 
->Users can sign up with the system. 
->log into the system. 
->change their password. 
->delete their account. 
->They can also update their bank account balance and transfer money to another user's bank account. 
#### I have implemented functions related to File I/O and dictionaries. Two of the functions require to import files and create dictionaries.
->User information will be imported from the "users.txt'' file
->account information will be imported from the "bank.txt" file. 
###### The remaining functions require you to use or modify the two dictionaries created from the files.
